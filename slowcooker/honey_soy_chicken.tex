Place chicken in a slow cooker. In a medium bowl whisk together honey, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, garlic, and sriracha sauce. Pour sauce into the slow cooker. Cover and cook for 3-4 hours on high or 6-8 hours on low.


Use a slotted spoon to transfer chicken to a large bowl, then shred with two forks.

Transfer sauce from the slow cooker to a medium sauce pan. Bring to a boil. Stir together cold water and corn starch in a small bowl until dissolved, then add to sauce pan and stir until thickened. Remove pan from heat and pour sauce over chicken.
