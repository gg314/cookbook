	\ingredientlist{
		\header{Refrigerated overnight:} \\
		2 large russet potatoes \\
		2 \t ground cumin \\
		2 \t ground coriander \\
		2 \t turmeric \\
		1 \t cayenne \\
		1 \T olive oil \\
		2 \T butter \\
		\sfrac{1}{2} \cup green onions  \\
		\sfrac{1}{4} \cup hot and/or sweet peppers, diced  \\
		\sfrac{1}{4} \cup cilantro, chopped \\
		salt, to taste
	}




	Combine cumin, coriander, turmeric, and cayenne together in small bowl. Mix well.

	Skin russet potatoes, cut in half, then into quarters, eighths, and sixteenths.

	Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add potatoes and \sfrac{2}{3} of the spice mixture and continue to boil until just tender and fairly easily pierced with a knife, about 10 minutes. Drain; transfer to a plate and let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.

	Wrap potatoes in plastic and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, 8 hours to overnight.

	Remove potatoes from the refrigerator and cut in half once more (optional).

	Heat butter and olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Add potatoes and season with salt. Cook until crisped, 3 to 5 minutes. Toss with a spatula and continue to cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes more. Sprinkle with remaining spice mixture, green onions, and chili peppers. Cook until onions and peppers just start to soften, 3 to 4 minutes.

	Transfer potatoes to a plate and top with cilantro.
