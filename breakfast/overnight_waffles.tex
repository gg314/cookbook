	\yieldsourcetime{4-6 servings}{Mark Bittman}{8 hours refrigerated}

	\pre{Eat these traditionally with butter and syrup for breakfast or use them as a ``bread'' to serve with virtually any meal. With a distrinctive yeasty flavor and a fluffy but chewy texture, they're that good.}

	\ingredientlist{
		\header{For the waffles:}

		\sfrac{1}{2} \tsp instant yeast

		2 \cups all-purpose flour

		\sfrac{1}{2} \tsp salt

		2 \cups milk

		8 \T (1 stick) butter, melted and cooled

		2 eggs

		\sfrac{1}{2} \tsp vanilla extract (opt.)

		neutral oil for brushing the iron

		\header{Don't forget!}

		maple syrup

		butter
	}

	The night before you want to serve the waffles, combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Stir in the milk, then the butter and the vanilla. The mixture will be creamy and loose. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside overnight at room temperature.

	To start baking brush the waffle iron lightly with oil and heat it. Separate the eggs and stir in the yolks into the batter. Beat the whites until they hold soft peaks. Fold them gently into the batter.

	Spread enough batter onto the waffle iron to barely cover it; bake until the waffle is done, usually 3 to 5 minutes. Serve immediately or keep warm in a 200\degree{F} oven.
