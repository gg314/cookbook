	\pre{Dough comes together quickly in a food processor. Nuts, seeds, citrus zest, spices, vanilla, minced dried fruit... ``As long as you maintain the butter-flour ratio (one stick of butter for every cup of flour), you are free to play around!'' The shortbread will solidify somewhat after cooling compared to when it is first removed from the oven.}

	\ingredientlist{
		2 \cups all-purpose flour

		\sfrac{2}{3} \cup granulated sugar

		1 \T finely chopped fresh rosemary

		1 \t plus 1 pinch kosher salt

		1 \cups unsalted cold butter, 1" chunks

		1-2 \t dark honey (rosemary, chestnut, etc.)
	}

	Heat oven to 325 degrees. In a food processor, pulse together flour, sugar, rosemary and salt. Add butter, and honey if desired, and pulse to fine crumbs. Pulse a few more times until some crumbs start to come together, but don't overprocess. Dough should not be smooth.

	Press dough into an ungreased 8" or 9" square baking pan or 9" pie pan. Prick dough all over with a fork. Bake until golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes for 9" pan, 45 to 50 minutes for 8". Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Cut into squares, bars or wedges while still warm.
