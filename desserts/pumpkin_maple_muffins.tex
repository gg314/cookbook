	\pre{This is a very special recipe. These muffins are just the right amount of sweet, lightly spiced, and deeply orange.}

	\ingredientlist{
		\sfrac{1}{2} stick unsalted butter

		1 all-purpose flour

		1 whole-wheat (or all-purpose) flour

		2 \t baking powder

		1 \t baking soda

		1\sfrac{1}{4} \t kosher salt

		2 \t ground cinnamon

		1 \t ground ginger

		\sfrac{1}{2} \t ground turmeric

		\sfrac{1}{4} \t ground nutmeg

		1\sfrac{1}{2} \cup pumpkin pur\'{e}e (15 oz. can)

		3 large eggs

		1 \cup light brown sugar

		\sfrac{2}{3} \cup maple syrup

	}

	Preheat oven to 350$^{\circ}$F. Spray muffin molds with nonstick spray or line with paper liners.

	Heat butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook, swirling occasionally, until the butter has melted, foamed and started to brown, about 5 minutes. Use a whisk to scrape up any browned bits at the bottom of the pot. Remove from heat and set aside.

	In a medium bowl, whisk together flours, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, turmeric and nutmeg.

	In a large bowl, whisk together pumpkin, eggs, brown sugar and maple syrup until totally smooth. Whisk in dry ingredients, followed by browned butter.

	Divide among prepared muffin tins and bake until the tops are puffed and spring back slightly when pressed, 20 to 25 minutes.
