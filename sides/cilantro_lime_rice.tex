Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan on medium high heat. Add the raw rice and stir to coat with the olive oil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the rice has started to brown.

Add the garlic and cook a minute more.

Add water, salt, and lime zest to the rice. Bring to a rolling boil, then cover and lower the heat to low, maintaining a very low simmer.

Cook undisturbed for 15 minutes (check your rice package instructions), then remove from heat and let sit for 10 minutes.

Fluff the rice with a fork.

Transfer the rice to a serving bowl. Pour lime juice over the rice and toss with chopped cilantro.
