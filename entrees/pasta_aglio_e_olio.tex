	\pre{Like all simple but fulfilling meals, this dish is more than the sum of its ingredients.}

	\ingredientlist{
		1 lb. pasta (traditionally, spaghetti) \\
		6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced \\
		1 (opt.) shallot, thinly sliced \\
		\sfrac{1}{2} \cups olive oil \\
		\sfrac{1}{4} \tsp red pepper flakes \\
		\sfrac{1}{4} \cup fresh chopped Italian parsley \\
		1 \cups grated Parmesan cheese \\
		salt, ground black pepper
	}


	Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti, stirring occasionally until \textit{al dente}: cooked through but firm, about 12 minutes. Keeping a cup or two of the pasta water on the side, drain and transfer noodles to a bowl.

	Combine garlic, optional shallot, and olive oil in a cold skillet. Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about 5 more minutes. Remove from heat.

	Stir red pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt into the pasta. Pour in olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on parsley and half of the Parmesan cheese. If the pasta seems dry, add a little pasta water to thicken the ``sauce''. Stir until combined.

	Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmesan cheese.
